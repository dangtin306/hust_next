# Core Engine: Gamification & Anti-Fraud Logic

## Credit Allocation Algorithm
The platform replaces "coins/rewards" with **Digital Credits** (also referred to as **Engagement Points**) to drive **User Engagement Metrics**. Credits are issued when users complete **Executing Micro-Interactions** that match campaign intent and evidence rules.

Allocation uses a weighted score that combines difficulty, completion quality, and user reputation:

```text
credit = base_rate
       * difficulty_weight
       * quality_score
       * reputation_multiplier
       * time_decay
```

Inputs:
- **difficulty_weight**: derived from interaction type (follow, vote, view) and proof strictness.
- **quality_score**: evidence confidence from verification pipeline.
- **reputation_multiplier**: dynamic trust tier based on historical success and dispute rate.
- **time_decay**: penalizes abnormal latency or burst patterns.

This model maintains a stable credit economy while incentivizing sustained engagement across campaigns.

## Automated Verification Layer
Evidence is validated by an **Automated Verification Worker** that combines AI/OCR and rule-based checks to confirm that **Executing Micro-Interactions** occurred on the target platform.

Verification stages:
- **OCR extraction** for screenshots and UI evidence.
- **Semantic validation** of metadata and platform identifiers.
- **Cross-check** against API signals or third-party telemetry when available.

```text
Evidence -> OCR -> Normalize -> Validate -> Confidence Score -> Credit Grant
```

This layer provides deterministic gating so credits are only released when evidence meets minimum confidence thresholds.

## Fraud Detection Protocol
The platform applies **Anomaly & Fraud Detection Algorithms** to prevent spam, click farms, and replayed evidence. Controls are enforced at both request and post-audit stages:

- **Rate limiting** per device and account.
- **Cooldown windows** to prevent burst submissions.
- **Reputation scoring** tied to dispute ratio and completion consistency.
- **Post-audit sweeps** to invalidate suspicious events and revoke credits.

```text
Signals -> Anomaly Scoring -> Quarantine -> Post-Audit -> Finalize
```

This protocol protects campaign integrity while keeping engagement pipelines responsive and scalable.
