# Core Engine: Gamification & Anti-Fraud Logic

### 1. Credit Allocation Algorithm
The platform utilizes **Digital Credits** (aka *Engagement Points*) to drive **User Engagement Metrics**. Credits are minted programmatically when users complete **Micro-Interactions** that successfully pass our multi-layer verification thresholds.

**Scoring Formula:**
```math
Credit_Grant = Base_Rate * Difficulty_Weight * Quality_Score * Reputation_Multiplier * Time_Decay
```

Parameters:
- **Difficulty_Weight**: interaction type + proof strictness.
- **Quality_Score**: evidence confidence from verification.
- **Reputation_Multiplier**: trust tier based on completion history.
- **Time_Decay**: penalizes abnormal latency or burst patterns.

This model keeps the credit economy stable while scaling engagement.

### 2. Automated Verification Layer
The **Automated Verification Worker** validates evidence via AI/OCR and rule-based checks, enforcing deterministic gating before credits are released.

```text
Evidence -> OCR -> Normalize -> Validate -> Confidence Score -> Credit Grant
```

Core controls:
- OCR extraction on screenshots and UI artifacts.
- Semantic validation of platform identifiers.
- Cross-check against API telemetry when available.

### 3. Fraud Detection Protocol
**Anomaly & Fraud Detection Algorithms** detect spam, click farms, and replay attacks:

- **Rate limiting** per device/account.
- **Cooldown windows** to prevent burst submissions.
- **Reputation scoring** tied to dispute ratio.
- **Post-audit sweeps** to revoke invalid credits.

```text
Signals -> Anomaly Scoring -> Quarantine -> Post-Audit -> Finalize
```

This protocol protects campaign integrity without degrading real-time UX.
